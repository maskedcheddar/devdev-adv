# devdev-adv
A small Java text adventure with cats and cakes

Attempt to run the adventure.jar file in runnable with:
```java -jar Adventure.jar```

## Instructions!

To move, enter the compass point of the exit you want to reach (```n```, ```e```, ```s```, ```w```), then hit enter

To pick up an item, type get [item name], then hit enter: ```get Instruction Document```

To use an item, same deal, but with use: ```use Salmon Fishcake```

And that's pretty much it!

## The Story!

You are a text adventure trope who wakes up in a clearing with no prior knowledge of anything. Through interacting with the world, you will discover its history, encounter its people and visit a science fiction convention.

## The Backstory!

This was created as part of personal development sessions as an introduction to Java. Don't expect this to be the next Mass Effect!

Any similarities to fictional square worlds that have, do or will exist is purely conincidental.
